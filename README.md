- 👋 Hi, I’m @DjDeijan
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and more specifically creating games with Unity. I also love to play guitar!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about procedural generation using Perlin noise and Poisson disc sampling as well as animal AI behaviour.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my own project that I am currently making. It is a top down 2d rpg that uses pixel art. It will be a survival/strategic game 
- - you are a person in an ancient setting on an island and you start from a simple person. Then you develop your combat skills and social status and can become
- a captain that can control a group of soldiers and take over fortresses. There will also be a story element to it - the game is set in ancient Eurasia. If you are 
- interested in this project and want to learn more about it, you can contact me through my email: deyanazmi154@gmail.com, or through my discord: FireDemon_154 #3305
